you can import other html code
by using a directive with an attribute include

you can import classes and the likes as well in your directives and call those

Not only can you build on top of code that others wrote but you can use jsps to 
auto convert into servlets for less out.println(*insert html shit here*)


So now lets talk about builtin objects:
BuiltIn Object (can be used in Scriptlet and Expression):
	Request (HttpServletRequest)
	Response (HttpServletResponse)
	PageContext (PageContext)
	Out (JspWriter) ~ PrintWriter object
	Session (HttpSession)
	Application (ServletContext)
	Config (ServletConfig)
	

You can refactor all your code to point to some Error screen.
	-> Instead of coding all your errors on one screen
	
Driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/navin

Don't write your business logic inside JSP
	-> Consider Servlet for this task
	
JSP = view 
Servlet = business logic (middle controller)
DBMS = backend (model)

Why is JSP view and not HTML?
	-> HTML = static pages
	-> JSP = dynamic pages
