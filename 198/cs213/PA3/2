The least amount of code rewrite in client for the same functionality implies that the client should not be concerned with the methods from the various sorts. 

Thus we could have one Sort interface which contains many method signatures and each *sort.java must implement Sort.

Thus the client can abstract away the worry of having to change the methods if they change the type of Sort object they use. 

The sort object they create must be statically typed to Sort but dynamically typed to the sorting algorithm they want to use.

This way by changing the dynamic type, they would change up the type of sort that the object uses in all their code but not have to change anything else.
