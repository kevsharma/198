Proof by Contradiction:
----------------------

Assume that d(s) = 0 and for every edge (x,y) we have: d(x) + w(x,y) >= d(y)
and that there exists a vertex such that d(v) > dist(s,v). (Assumption 1)

Let B = {v exists in V | d(v) > dist(s,v)}
Let child be a vertex in B. (Proposition 1)

Then d(child) > dist(s, child).

Let parent be the vertex that exists in In(child) such that the path from [s to ... to parent to child] forms the minimum path.
That is, dist(s,child) is the distance of the path which 1. starts at s and 2. goes through parent to 3. get to child.

However if d(child) > dist(s,child), then we cannot pick the aforementioned minimum path.
Hence d(child) is the distance of a non-minimum path which 
1.starts at s and 2.goes through any vertex in In(child) except for parent to get 3.to child.

Note that any non-minimum path has a distance greater than any minimum path from s to child. (Proposition 2)

Let the value of minimum path k 	= d(parent) + w(parent, child)
Let the value of non-minimum path q 	> dist(s, child)

By proposition 2, we have k < q.
Equivalently, d(parent) + w(parent, child) < dist(s, child)

Equivalently, substituting Proposition 1 we have
	-> d(parent) + w(parent, child) < dist(s, child) < d(child)
	-> d(parent) + w(parent, child) < d(child) (Final Statement)
	
Note that *Final Statement* violates the KEY PROPERTY that d(x) + w(x,y) has to be >= d(y).

Specifically, d(parent) + w(parent, child) has to be greater than or equal to d(child) by KEY PROPERTY.
Given our Proposition 1, this KEY PROPERTY is violated.

Hence there is no such vertex child which exists in B.
The cardinality of B, the set of all bad vertices in prompt, is therefore 0.

Therefore, there exists no vertex where d(vertex) > dist(s, vertex).

We have thus proved that d(v) <= dist(s,v) for all vertices v exists in V.





An example:
-----------
Say we had a graph:

	      50	20 
	s -------> a ---------> c
	|			^
	|			|
	|	100		|70
	-------------->b --------

Then if child = c exists in B, d(child) > dist(s,child)
Hence d(child) > 70. This implies that d(child) is not representative of the path with minimum distance from s to c. 

Here d(child) can take on the value 170 using the path s->b->c.
But note that there exists a path s->a->c where the edge (a,c) violates the key property that d(a) + w(a,c) >= d(c).
In particular: d(a) + w(a,c) >= 170 equals 50 + 20 >= 170 which is logically false.

The violation of this key property is not permissible, hence c cannot exist in B.
Since we assumed that c existed in B, but it can't, we have a contradiction of our assumption that there exists a vertex d(v) > dist(s,v).
