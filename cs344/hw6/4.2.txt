No, every vertex in G' is not necessarily in the path from the start vertex of a cycle to the end vertex of said cycle.

			 --->b

Let G = 	s -----> a -------> c
			 ^	    |
			 |	    |
			 ------------

Here G has a directed cycle(a,c).
After running RemoveZeroDegree(G), we get G' as:



		--->b
		|
Then G' = 	a -------> c
		^	    |
		|	    |
		------------

Because a lies on a cycle, the while loop cannot remove outgoing edges from a.
Hence, even though b which has an incoming edge from a AND doesn't lie on the cycle(a,c), exists in G'.

So it is not necessarily the case that every vertex in G' is on some directed cycle. This can be seen by the fact that b does not contribute to a cycle.
