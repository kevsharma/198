problem 1: part 1
===============

Table: row 2 is d(element in row 1) corresponding to when that vertex is explored. row 1 is the order in which the vertices are explored.

		1		2		3		4		5		6		7
 r1		s		a		e		d		c		f		b	
 r2		0		3		4		7		8		9		14



problem 2: part 2
===============
topological ordering #1:	f, a, d, b, c, g, e
 
topological ordering #2:	f, a, d, b, c, e, g
