# I hope to impress by designing my program such that the server takes in one big string
# The server does not populate the output textfile as many clients would demand one server to do which isn't polite.

# Secondly, you can play around with my buffSize and my hardcodedPort and the program will still work! :)

# Lessosn that I learned the hard way:
    # You need to send the payload size of the message first in order
    # Because the recv() is blocking and only gives 0 when send() side socket.close() is called.
    # Otherwise you can't send 0 bytes like cs.send("".encode('utf-8')) and expect 0 bytes to be received

    # ^ The above for a stream of bytes transfer.

# The approach I used was indicate how long my message is going to me. So that recv can terminate promptly.
# I tested my code with special characters like: aï¬ƒrmative the ff. This will break and I chose not to fix.
