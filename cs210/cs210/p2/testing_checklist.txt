CS210 Assignment 2 Testing Checklist

Problem 1: Pokemon Box Dataset
-pokemon.py is executable

1)
-Avoids division by zero if there are no fire type pokemons
-The output percentage for 2/3 is 67
-The output percengage for 5/6 is 83
-The output percentage for 11/200 is 6, not 5

2)
-Correctly fills in the NaN values for type based on weakness
-If there is a tie, the type that appears first alphabetically is filled in for missing value


3)
-For pokemon levels > 40, the average rounds to 1 decimal
-For pokemon levels <= 40, the average rounds to 1 decimal
-If there is only one level <=40 or only one level >40, NaN is not replaced with an average for any atk, hp, or dek in that row
-If every atk, hp, or dek value is NaN, NaN is not replaced with an average


4)
-Each type has a personality mapped to it
-Both keys and values are ordered alphabetically
-Output csv file pokemon4.txt is correctly formatted

5)
-Average value is rounded off
-If every stage is less than 3, NaN is returned for the output average
-Output csv file pokemon5.txt is correctly formatted


Problem 2: Covid-19 Dataset
-covid.py is executable

1)
-The range (0-1) and (0-0) returns 0 as average
-If input file has no ranges, the numbers are left as they are

2)
-If month and date are the same, the output is still correct

3)
-If there is only one province in the input file that has an NaN value for longitude and/or latitude, NaN is filled in for that value

4)
-If there is a tie, the city that comes first alphabetically is filled in
-If there is only once province in the input file and it has an NaN value, NaN is returned

5)
-If a province appears once and has NaN for symptoms, NaN is returned
-Frequencies are counted correctly for symptoms with both semicolon and spaces and for just semicolons

Problem 3: Text Processing

1)
-Words ending with -ment,-ly, and -ing are stemmed
-Url links, trailing and leading spaces are removed and all letters are lowercased
-non-words and stopwords are removed
-If tfidf_docs.txt has a new line, it is ignored


2)
-1 is added both if idf is 0 or non-zero
-Average is rounded to two decimal places
-The top five words returned are in alphabetical order
-3 documents with 5 tuples are returned, if there are less than 5 of the top words, then all of the words are returned
